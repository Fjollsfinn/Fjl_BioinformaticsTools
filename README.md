# Fjl_BioinformaticsTools
Fjl_Metalloproteins.py script is a very helpfull tool for scientists who are working with metalloproteins. Script is collecting data about metalloproteins by PDB codes and store it into tables. You can easly look for specific binding site and/or residues with this tool. The Script has been written in Python 3.5.2 and it is using pymysql library. To run it, you will need my MySQL databases which you can download from Fjl_BioinformaticsTools repository. If you'd like to make any changes contact me on e-mail.
